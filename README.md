Signup on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) and keep looking for meetups around Boston. There are always loads of them and it's really good to talk to random people about Tech. Remember that networking is a by-product of talking to people and is not the main goal, because it is so obvious and plastic when you're just talking to the person for their LinkedIn connection.
